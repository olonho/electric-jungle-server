rules_1=Welcome to the Java programming contest where you can create \
algorithms of virtual creatures' group behavior competing      \
each other for a limited resource. \
Each player programs the behavior of his or her creatures so as to obtain the maximum \
results. The criterion for success is the sum of the mass of \
all creatures (total mass) after a certain number of steps.
rules_sdk=\
  <h2 class="alt">Download SDK</h2>                                    \
  <p>To participate you need the following SDK (software developer's kit). \
  It contains the engine sources, viewer, developer's documentation and sample algorithm \
  showing how to implement the behavior of a simple creature.
rules_coding=\
   <h2>Coding</h2>                                                                       \
<p>The main goal of the contest participants is to implement the <tt>makeTurn()</tt> \
method of the <tt>Being</tt> interface. As an example, you can use the <tt>SimpleBeing</tt> \
class and start with the <tt>BeingTemplate</tt> template. You can write code in either the \
NetBeans IDE or any text editor (the engine can access the compiler to compile your code; \
for detailed instructions, see <tt>README.txt</tt>). The engine source code will be \
available to players. However, the final engine version used to choose the winner might \
differ from early versions.</p> \
 <p><b class="hl">Note</b>: Carefully read the <tt>Constants.java</tt> file \
  as, along with the engine source, it contains important information about \
the world and is a valuable documentation source.<br /> \
<p>One week before the competition deadline, the engine source code will be frozen to \
let the players fine-tune their code to the final version.</p>
rules_notes=\
<h2>Tips and Notes</h3> \
<ul> \
    <li>The engine is optimized to run on multi-core and multi-processor \
machines, such as <a href="http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T1/"> \
Niagara</a>. Thus, <tt>makeTurn()</tt> for one kind of creatures can be simultaneously \
running on several cores or processors. Therefore, access to shared data \
(such as static variables) must be synchronized. Likewise, both \
<tt>makeTurn()</tt> and <tt>processEvent()</tt> must also be synchronized. \
    </li>\
\
    <li>Execution of <tt>makeTurn()</tt> should not take long. Otherwise, \
 the engine deletes your creature from the playing area. Because the  \
duration of timeouts depends on the number of active creatures and the \
overall server load, please avoid using complex time-consuming \
algorithms.</li> \
</ul>
rules_security=\
<h2>Security</h2> \
<p>The game has a security system, which is disabled by default. \
Before the competition, you can check your creatures by starting the \
game with the <tt>&ndash;secure</tt> option and adding the content \
of the <tt>java.policy</tt> file to the Java policy file.</p>
rules_notation=\
<h2 class="alt">Notations</h2> \
<ul> \
    <li><b class="hl">X %ME</b> &mdash; Percentage of the creature's \
    maximum energy (ME).</li> \
\
    <li><b class="hl">K_someconst</b>(5) &mdash; Constant that defines \
    the value of a single parameter of the game (all the constants are defined in \
    <code>Constants.java</code>).\
    The current value is indicated in parentheses. While most of the \
    constants will preserve these values during entire contest, changes are possible \
    if some serious disbalance noticed.</li> \
</ul>
rules_concepts=\
<h2>Concepts and Goals</h2> \
<p>In the world of the Electric Jungle (EJ) the main goal is to achieve maximal expansion of your \
species.</p> \
<p>Each player programs the behavior of his creatures so as to obtain the maximum results. \
The criteria for success is a total mass (the sum of masses of all creatures) via a \
certain number of turns.</p> \
<p><b class="hl">Space and time.</b> In EJ space is constructed as a two-dimensional \
field made of cells with circumscribed  boundaries so that the field has the form of a torus. \
Other topologies and dimensions are also supported by engine, although contest winners will be \
defined on using torus topology on field 140x120. \
Time consit of sequence of turns. During each turn each creature has a chance to perform an \
action. After all the creatures have completed their actions, the next turn begins. \
In the general case, the order of actions is not defined, and different creatures can \
perform their actions simultaneously. </p> \
<p><b class="hl">Mass and speed.</b> Every creature in EJ has two basic characteristics: \
mass and speed. Creature also characterized by its energy level. The mass corresponds \
to the maximum energy (ME) that the creature \
can have. If the energy level falls below <code>K_emin(15%)</code> ME, the creature dies and all \
of its remaining energy becomes available to other creatures. \
Mass cannot exceed <code>K_maxmass</code>(1000) and cannot be less than <code>K_minmass</code>(0.1). \
Speed cannot exceed <code>K_maxspeed</code>(10) and cannot be less than <code>K_minspeed</code>(1).</p> \
\
Total mass is the sum of masses of all living creatures. Mass determines the number of scores \
the participant has, the energy capacity and energy consumption per turn (equal \
to square root of mass by <code>K_masscost</code>), and the degree of \
injury that the creature can get (attacking or being attacked). At the end of the game, \
total mass is used to determine the winner: wins the player with the maximum total mass. \
<p>Speed determines the maximum distance at which a creature can move in one turn. However, the higher \
the speed, the more energy a creature consumes to move. Regardless of speed, a creature can \
obtain information only about the point of its location, and about the neighboring points.</p> \
\
<p><b class="hl">Energy</b> is the basis of existence in EJ. Any action \
(even just surviving) requires \
consumption of some energy.  The sources of energy are randomly placed on the field at the beginning \
of the game. Creatures can derive energy from these sources (no more than 10% of ME). \
The energy sources have the ability to regenerate energy. \
The initial amount of energy and its regeneration speed \
are randomly specified and vary for different sources. There are <code>NUM_REGULAR(130)</code> \
of regular energy sources and <code>NUM_GOLDEN(3)</code> of golden sources on the field. \
The golden sources produce much more energy than the regular ones. Also at the cell where first \
creature is born there is always an energy source with BORN_BONUS(100) energy and growth of \
BORN_BONUS_GROWTH(1). \
Although energy and its increase are differentially distributed on the field in different games,\
 the total energy and increase are always identical.<br /></p> \
\
<p><b class="hl">Outer world information.</b> A creature can obtain outer world information by \
using the <code>BeingIntreface</code> and <code>PointInfo</code> APIs. \
The following information is available:</p> \
\
<ul>\
    <li>Amount of energy the creature has</li> \
    <li>Owner and mass of any creature in the neighborhood (within the same cell or at adjacent cells)</li>\
    <li>Amount of energy, its regeneration speed, and the maximum capacity in the cell</li> \
    <li>List of all objects at a given point (in particular, the list of other creatures) \
    <li>Total mass of all living creatures at a given point</li> \
</ul>

rules_actions=\
<h2>Actions and Events</h2> \
\
At each step a creature can perform only one action at a single turn and is notified about the   \
events that are happening to it. The order in which being's actions are actually performed isn't \
specified. If action requested cannot be performed, it's just ignored. The following actions are available \
(see <code>EventKind.java</code>): \
<ul> \
    <li><code>ACTION_MOVE_TO</code> &mdash; Move to another cell. The availability of the \
        cell is determined by the speed of the creature. The cost is <code>K_movecost(1)%</code> \
        of the speed.</li> \
    <li><code>ACTION_EAT</code> &mdash; Consume energy. \
         Creature's energy cannot exceed the energy capacity (mass) of the creatures \
         and consumed energy can't be greater than <code>K_bite(10)%</code> of the maximum energy (ME). \
         Free of charge.</li> \
    <li><code>ACTION_GIVE</code> &mdash; Transfer energy to another creature. Free of charge. \
            Creatures must be on the same cell.</li> \
    <li><code>ACTION_ATTACK</code> &mdash; Attack another creature hurting that creature by  \
        <code>K_fight(20)%</code> of the maximum energy (ME) (attacker loses energy by \
        <code>K_fightcost(1)%</code> of its own energy  + <code>K_retaliate(5)%</code> of the attacked \
         creature's energy).</li> \
    <li><code>ACTION_BORN</code> &mdash; Give birth to another creature. The child might \
        be slightly different from the parent but can't vary too much from parent in mass \
        and speed (by more than K_minbornvariation(0.8)/K_maxbornvariation(1.2), \
        (i.e. creature with mass 100 and speed 2 can give birth to creatures with mass \
         from 80 till 120 and speed from 1.6 till 2.4) \
        The energy is divided between the parent and the child equally. The act of birth is possible \
        only if a creature has enough energy which is no less than K_toborn(80%). The act \
        of birth costs K_borncost(20)% of the maximum energy (ME). In addition, the child \
        can be granted its own 'genocode' (a new Java object of your choice). </li> \
    <li><code>ACTION_MOVE_ATTACK</code> &mdash; Ability to move and attack in one action, the \
       ability to hurt is reduced by <code>K_fightmovepenalty(0.75)</code>. \
       The cost equals to the sum of the attack cost and the move cost.<br /></li>\
</ul>\
\
<p>The creature can get notifications about the following events:</p>\
<ul> \
    <li><code>BEING_BORN</code> &mdash; The first notification. The creature gets \
        this notification when it is born.</li> \
    <li><code>BEING_DEAD</code> &mdash; The last notification. The creature gets \
        this notification when it dies.</li> \
    <li><code>BEING_ATTACKED</code> &mdash; The creature is being attacked by \
        somebody. The identifier of the attacker is passed as a parameter.</li> \
    <li><code>BEING_ENERGY_GIVEN</code> &mdash; Somebody has given energy to the creature.</li> \
</ul>

rules_game=\
<h2>Game</h2> \
<p>To begin the game, engine places one creature of every player on a random spot in space \
and also once invokes the <code>Being.reinit()</code> method. \
The <code>reinit()</code> method provides information about the current \
conditions of the game and lets you reinitialize static variables. \
The parameters of the first creature are determined by the return value \
of the <code>Being.getParams()</code> method. The parameters of all other \
creatures are determined by the parameters of the <code>ACTION_BORN</code> \
action. Once born, each creature is able to win under given circumstances \
as described below.</p>
